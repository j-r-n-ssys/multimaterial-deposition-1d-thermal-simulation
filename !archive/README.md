# FDM-1D-Thermodynamic-Modeling
Modeling of a single-wall FDM deposition process (thermodynamic and adhesion development) using a one-dimensional finite difference approximation.  

## Project: Non-Isotropic Thermal Conductivity
Modeling of amorphous molten polymer (T > Tg) deposited onto a solid amorphous thermoplastic (T < Tg) bed with dissimilar thermal conductivity (K).  Comparing cases when K<sub>molten</sub> >> K<sub>solid</sub> and K<sub>solid</sub> >> K<sub>molten</sub>.  Example: Unfilled support material (K ~= 0.1 W/m-K) and heavily filled (with stainless steel model material (K ~= 6.0 W/m-K).  This work was done to support sinterable thermoplastic model material development.
